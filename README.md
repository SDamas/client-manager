# Client Manager Web Application

The client manager web application is a college project.
The proposal received was to build an application where users could make CRUD operations. I saw that a client manager would be a great way of demonstrating it, due to the functionalities of clients being added, edited and deleted from the application.

## Description

The Client Manager is a web application that helps self-employed individuals or businesses to keep track of their customers relationships. It allows users to add, edit and delete client information.

Clients in the Client Manager include basic details like names and phone numbers, and additional information such as email addresses, company, project and notes about interactions.

This web application is both useful for personal use as well as for businesses.
